## Overview

This dataset reflects incidents of crime in the City of Los Angeles dating from 2010 to present. This data is transcribed from original crime reports that are typed on paper. We selected only 2018 to 2022. 

This interactive dashboard has: 
- User-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the data. 
- Charts to show frequency of crimes amongst various demographics. 
- Map of Los Angeles City crime rate by location.
- Allows the user to select the year and the type of crime
